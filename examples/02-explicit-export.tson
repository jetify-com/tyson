// When there are several expressions in a file, how does TySON choose which one
// to evaluate as JSON?
// Simple: it always uses the default export

var one = {
  one: 1
}

var two = {
  two: 2
}

var three = {
  three: 3
}

export default two; // This is the default export

// This file evaluates to the following JSON:
// {
//   "two": 2
// }
